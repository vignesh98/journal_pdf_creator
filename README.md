# journal_pdf_creator
A pdf journal creator app which outputs a 365 page pdf with dates embedded to write it on iPadâ„¢ or any stylus suported devices.

This was made as i was searching for good journal apps and found them too cluttered whereas i wanted a simple journal taking app which can be exported as PDF for later viewing. As its a document, this can be put in any cloud storage and there is no need to regularly backup, you can write on it using a stylus and it will save it.
